 when will people stop being offended by women showing skin  expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think it's time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world it's shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i don't think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if i'm speaking about something that i'm passionate about i'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things i'd like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit there's lots we've got to get started on that's what we need to focus on we've got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on california's power 06 fm  i'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy i'm not big sean's ex i'm not niall's new possible girl i'm ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual 
 people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies it's okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies we were having fun dancing on stage 'what's she shaking tho' i'm shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nicki's pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled 'after black power women's liberation' and 46 years later  we're still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  she's a 'slut' if a man has sex  he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used 'bitches'hoes'  how lovely he's had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on twitter

 the first line of 'focus' is 'i know what i came to do and that ain't gonna change' what i came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love to share to listen to improve to learn to share music to share experience to share feelings to make people feel happy and empowered she explained  to make people feel like they're not alone without using my voice to do those things i would feel empty she continued when i say 'focus on me' i'm not asking to be the center of attention i'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice by 'focus on me' i literally mean focus on me focus on what i'm all about and what i believe in  the more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like what we're wearing our gender our hairstyle our sexuality the color of our skin but focus on each other on a soul level the more we realize how much we have in common the more we listen to each other the more one we become  the title of ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her too since she's had such a tumultuous year ahem remember the donut incident but she insists this is about all of us  you judge because you don't focus on me you don't focus on each other she explained you judge because you focus on appearance on clothes you focus on what you want from me what you want from people how you want them to wear their hair you judge me you wanna see me dressed a certain way how you wanna see their makeup their eyebrows you focus on what you think people should be like for you but when you stop and you actually focus on someone you'll see the light in them when you focus on me you see the light in me when we focus on each other we see the light in each other and even if you don't this is who we are what are we making fun of what's there to make fun of we should apologize for that

 so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character 
   but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies 
 thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever

 being empowered is not the same as being a bitch having something to say is not the same as having a bad attitude  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you i have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because i have come to the realization that i have so much more to talk about i'm currently making the best music i've ever made in my life having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people i've ever known working my ass off every single day performing  creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day  i come from a long bloodline of female activists my aunt judy was the first italian american female president of the national press club in washington dc i think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled after black power women's liberation and 46 years later we're still not quite there yet if a women has a lot of sex or any sex for that matter she's a slut if a man has sex he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes how lovely he's had he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things i've done  things i'm going through i don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before i love y'all with all my heart you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me  any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke she will need her sisterhood  gloria steinem

 i hop up out my bed and get my swag on i look in the mirror say what's up what's up what's up what's up i hop up out my bed and get my swag on i look in the mirror say what's up what's up what's up what's up 
 if i were a boy even just for a day i'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what i wanted then go drink beer with the guys and chase after girls i'd kick it with who i wanted and i'd never get confronted for it 'cause they'd stick up for me 
 if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear i'd be a better man i'd listen to her 'cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed 
 if i were a boy i would turn off my phone tell everyone it's broken so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone i'd put myself first and make the rules as i go 'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful waitin' for me to come home to come home 
 if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear i'd be a better man i'd listen to her 'cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted wanted 'cause he's taken you for granted granted and everything you had got destroyed 
 it's a little too late for you to come back say it's just a mistake think i'd forgive you like that if you thought i would wait for you you thought wrong 
 but you're just a boy you don't understand yeah you don't understand oh how it feels to love a girl someday you'll wish you were a better man you don't listen to her you don't care how it hurts until you lose the one you wanted 'cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy 
 you can taste the dishonesty it's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier but even that's a test constantly aware of it all my lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world 
 pray to catch you whispering i pray you catch me listening i'm prayin' to catch you whispering i pray you catch me i'm prayin' to catch you whispering i pray you catch me listening i pray you catch me 
 nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face when it's only in my memory it don't hit me quite the same maybe it's a cause for concern but i'm not at ease keeping my head to the curb 
 pray to catch you whispering i pray you catch me listening i pray to catch you whispering whisper whisper i pray you catch me whisper whisper i pray you catch me i pray you catch me pray you i'm praying you catch me

 if you search for tenderness it isn't hard to find you can have the love you need to live but if you look for truthfulness you might just as well be blind it always seems to be so hard to give 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you 
 i can always find someone to say they sympathize if i wear my heart out on my sleeve but i don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies all i want is someone to believe 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you 
 i can find a lover i can find a friend i can have security until the bitter end anyone can comfort me with promises again i know i know 
 when i'm deep inside of me don't be too concerned i won't ask for nothin' while i'm gone but when i want sincerity tell me where else can i turn because you're the one that i depend upon 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you

 we need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality it isnt a reality yet today women make up half of the us workforce but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the opportunities

 there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things 
  i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message 
 all in all you've been there for me you showed me things i would never see i think i'm ready by my side you been waitin' respectfully and oh so patient i think i'm ready i feel it in my chest as i dance with you got so much control you haven't made a move you give me reassurance in the things you do and that's why i think i'm ready 
 baby i'm not afraid to go the way but it's my first time and baby i know you wanna change the speed and i'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time and baby i'm not afraid to go the way but it's my first time and baby i know you wanna change the speed and i'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time 
 arm in arm eye to eye as the music plays emotions rise i think i'm ready in your eyes i see three words hold me tight 'cause i'm about to burst i think i'm ready i feel it in my chest as i dance with you got so much control you haven't made a move you give me reassurance in the things you do and that's why i think i'm ready 
  backing vocals it's my first time remember your first time it's my first time 
 it felt like 
 i gotta give up to quiet the storm that rages inside the way that i hid my damage pride you gave me away and i've had enough i imagine the words i say to you i'm finding strength to follow it through i'm ready to change 
 i'm letting go i'm letting go we're only friends we're only friends tonight we'll let the music free our soul so let it show so let it show we can't pretend we can't pretend we'll only find ourselves by losing all control control control control control control control control 
 i'm opening up show me a sign i can't believe these crazy emotions flow through me i'm gonna explode oh you take me away and what is my ordinary life i won't be afraid of what we might find a love i can hold 
 i'm letting go i'm letting go we're only friends we're only friends tonight we'll let the music free our soul so let it show so let it show we can't pretend we can't pretend we'll only find ourselves by losing all no 
 nothing ventured nothing gained new horizon ready to paint with every breath you take me away 
 i'm letting go i'm letting go we're only friends we're only friends tonight we'll let the music free our soul so let it show so let it show we can't pretend we can't pretend we only find ourselves by loosing all control control control control control control control control

 i wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me and it came so effortlessly after i finished the film of my life dreamgirls because i was so inspired by deena i wrote songs that were saying all the things i wish she would have said in the film and i wanted to give you an extra special song that deena sings it's a pivotal moment when deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants i'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics this is listen

 i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time 
  i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening 
  i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today

 you and me we made a vow for better or for worse i can't believe you let me down but the truth's in the way it hurts for months on end i've had my doubts denying every tear i wish this would be over now but i know that i still need you here 
 you say i'm crazy 'cause you don't think i know what you've done but when you call me baby i know i'm not the only one 
 you've been so unavailable and sadly i know why your heart is unattainable even though lord knows you kept mine 
 you say i'm crazy 'cause you don't think i know what you've done but when you call me baby i know i'm not the only one 
 i have loved you for many years maybe i am just not enough you've made me realise my deepest fear by lying and tearing us up 
 you say i'm crazy 'cause you don't think i know what you've done but when you call me baby i know i'm not the only one 
 and i know and i know and i know and i know and i know i know i'm not the only one i know i'm not the only one i know i'm not the only one 
 what would you do what would you do if i handed you a drug that'd teach you something new what would you feel what would you feel if i took over the fake and made them all real what would you say what would you say if i told you it's actually gon' be a good day 
 maybe all things happen for a reason you just need to get over this dry season but the only drug you need is believing maybe god does answer all your prayers maybe need to let go of the fear of being let down from the people you keep near maybe it's because you're running low on gear maybe god does answer all your prayers 
 what do you need what do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed what do you hear what do you hear what do you hear when i tell you i'm always near i made it pretty clear what do you see what do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free you got a friend in me 
 maybe all things happen for a reason you just need to get over this dry season but the only drug you need is believing maybe god does answer all your prayers maybe need to let go of the fear of being let down from the people you keep near maybe it's because you're running low on gear maybe god does answer all your prayers 
 and i'm still here and i'm holding hard onto your hand but it still feels like you're never gonna understand one can drown alone but we can swim together 
 maybe all things happen for a reason you just need to get over this dry season but the only drug you need is believing maybe god does answer all your prayers and let go of the fear of being let down from the people you keep near is it because you're running low on gear maybe god does answer all your prayers

 i'm sorry if i seem uninterested or i'm not listenin' or i'm indifferent truly i ain't got no business here but since my friends are here i just came to kick it but really i would rather be at home all by myself not in this room with people who don't even care about my wellbeing i don't dance don't ask i don't need a boyfriend so you can go back please enjoy your party i'll be here somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollering i can hardly hear over this music i don't listen to and i don't wanna get with you so tell my friends that i'll be over here 
 ohohoh here ohohoh here oh i ask myself what am i doin' here ohohoh here ohohoh here and i can't wait 'til we can break up outta here 
 excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this an antisocial pessimist but usually i don't mess with this and i know you mean only the best and your intentions aren't to bother me but honestly i'd rather be somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen to some music with a message like we usually do and we'll discuss our big dreams how we plan to take over the planet so pardon my manners i hope you'll understand that i'll be her not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends so tell them i'll be here right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more oh god why am i here 
 ohohoh here ohohoh here oh i ask myself what am i doin' here ohohoh here ohohoh here and i can't wait 'til we can break up outta here 
 hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator some girl talkin' 'bout her haters she ain't got none how did it ever come to this i shoulda never come to this so holla at me i'll be in the car when you're done i'm standoffish don't want what you're offerin' and i'm done talkin' awfully sad it had to be that way so tell my people when they're ready that i'm ready and i'm standin' at the tv with my beanie low yo i'll be over here 
 ohohoh here ohohoh here ask myself what am i doin' here ohohoh here ohohoh here 
 hmm ohohoh here here hmm here here are we over here 
 once there was a way to get back homeward once there was a way to get back home

 lyrics from snippet  imma hate it when i'm picking up you i just don't wanna breathe the same air choking on your smoke smashing on your mirrors gonna vacate the fake so i see clearer running out of ways to love you i'm running out of ways to care  don't you wear your own mouth walking around and throwing shade caught up in your mind games but did i think you'd ever change  i'm running out of ways to love you i'm running out of ways to care imma hate it when i'm picking up you i just don't wanna breathe the same air i'm running out of ways to love you i'm running out of ways to care imma hate it when i'm picking up you i just don't wanna breathe the same air choking on your smoke smashing on your mirrors gonna vacate the fake so i see clearer running out of ways to love you i'm running out of ways to care  and i tried and i tried and i tried but it just doesn't feel right like a night like a night like a night with a sunrise  i'm running out of ways to love you i'm running out of ways to care imma hate it when i'm picking up you i just don't wanna breathe the same air  you are looking two faced you need another pair of shades 
 all along it was a fever a cold sweat hotheaded believer i threw my hands in the air said show me something he said if you dare come a little closer  pre 'round and around and around and around we go oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know 
 not really sure how to feel about it something in the way you move makes me feel like i can't live without you it takes me all the way i want you to stay 
 it's not much of a life you're living it's not just something you take it's given  pre 'round and around and around and around we go oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know 
 not really sure how to feel about it something in the way you move makes me feel like i can't live without you it takes me all the way i want you to stay 
 the reason i hold on 'cause i need this hole gone funny you're the broken one but i'm the only one who needed saving 'cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving 
 not really sure how to feel about it something in the way you move makes me feel like i can't live without you it takes me all the way i want you to stay i want you to stay i want you to stay i want you to stay

 i want you all say it before you run out of time i want you all say it before it's too late i want you all say what i am feeling now i want you all waiting is insane thank you so much

 if you came by me would i crown you my king or brush you off as though i really didn't see if you walked by my side would our souls then be unified i swore your name would never be denied 
 but i took up this hammer and laughed at all your slander and pierced your hands with the nails of blasphemy how could i do this i don't know said something forced me to it so spit in your face and passed you by 
 but time and time again i'd live that life of sin i knew it hurt you bad but i wasn't ready to give in maybe someday but not this day i said i wanted to live my life i was willing to pay the price 
 but i took up this hammer and laughed at all your slander and pierced your hands with the nails of blasphemy how could i do this i don't know said something forced me to it so spit in your face and passed you by 'cause i'd forgotten those words your name won't be denied 
 but looking into my eyes i knew you felt this heart's cry i needed you bad my life was oh so sad but looking back at all this pain this guilt this strife would you take it all away if i were to give you back my life 
 but you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee  4 he was hanging on a cross with a crown of thorns in his head he was hanging on a cross with a crown of thorns in his head he was hanging on a cross with a crown of thorns in his head he was hanging on a cross with a crown of thorns in his head 
 and you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee and you said i've forgiven thee 
 comparisons are easily done once you've had a taste of perfection like an apple hanging from a tree i picked the ripest one i still got the seed  pre  you said move on where do i go i guess second best is all i will know 
  'cause when i'm with him i am thinking of you thinking of you what you would do if you were the one who was spending the night oh i wish that i was looking into your eyes 
 you're like an indian summer in the middle of winter like a hard candy with a surprise center how do i get better once i've had the best you said there's tons of fish in the water so the waters i will test  pre  he kissed my lips i taste your mouth oh he pulled me in i was disgusted with myself 
  'cause when i'm with him i am thinking of you thinking of you what you would do if you were the one who was spending the night oh i wish that i was looking into 
 you're the best and yes i do regret how i could let myself let you go now the lesson's learned i touched it i was burned oh i think you should know  breakdown yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what you would do if 
  you were the one who was spending the night oh i wish that i was looking into your eyes looking into your eyes looking into your eyes won't you walk through and bust in the door and take me away yeah no more mistakes 'cause in your eyes i want to stay 
 ohoh woahoh woah stay

 you come over don't talk turn the tv on off disconnected unaffected better take the call 
 show you pictures of my hometown a pin could drop from miles down what's the use in trying to be a girlfriend when i know just what we are  pre  there's nothing in common except the bed we lay on 
 i won't be caught between something and nothing when you know that nothing is for free cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers and it's empty in between 
 you're a habit i can't break disaster to eliminate what part of no do i not understand when you're no good for me  pre  cause i know we will never be some kind of forever 
 extended i won't be caught between something and nothing when you know that nothing is for free cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers and it's empty in between cause i'm the girl who needs it all or nothing how did we become a onenight stand hanging on the thread just isn't something that i want in the end no oh it's empty in between 
 you come over yeah it's over oh we know just what we are 
 extended i won't be caught between something and nothing when you know that nothing is for free cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers and it's empty in between cause i'm the girl who needs it all or nothing how did we become a onenight stand hanging on the thread just isn't something that i want in the end no oh it's empty in between

 caught in the eye of the hurricane slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade so sick of this town pulling me down my mother said i should come back home but can't find the way 'cause the way is gone so if i pray am i just sending words into outer space 
 have you ever been so lost known the way and still so lost another night waiting for someone to take me home have you ever have you ever been yeah oh yeah 
 oh is there a light is there a light at the end of the road cause i'm pushing everyone away 'cause i can't feel this anymore i can't feel 
 have you ever been so lost known the way and still so so lost so lost oh yeah another night waiting for someone to take me home have you ever been so have you have you ever been been so lost

 stephen fry i know people talk to you about all the same things but one of the things i just wanted to talk to you about because its so obvious coming here is the thing i think that you always say is most important to you which is the fans and theyre all outside and i gather you took them out some hot chocolate  lady gaga actually well i sent them hot chocolate yesterday and macaroons and then today i had press all day and i felt bad because i usually would leave the hotel and i would go to say hi but i knew that i wouldnt have time and theyd be waiting all day so i just went down and i brought them some fresh cookies and flowers  sf ooooh and do you find theres a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity is there a kind of gaga fan who has a commonality  lg yes there is the little monsters are a community and its kind of nice that everywhere i go they create a little home for me  sf both those who i suppose describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you as i do im unashamed to say would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed the marginal the freakish the outsider the sexually different the ugly the fat the one who doesnt fit in the one who feels outside the tribe if you like  lg yes it could be anybody sf which in fact is most of us none of us really feels we belong just some of us are better at hiding it than others lg i think so some of us wear the mask prouder than others sf yes exactly and the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that i suppose born this way and the title song of it lg yes the album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life sf oh so its not just that god made me gay or god made me lesbian or god made me bi and thats who i am lg no sf its about being reborn is it lg no not really

 charlamagne let's shift gears for a minute and talk about new york city i actually get in arguments because people say nicki doesn't rep new york i say what do you mean she shouts it out all of the time  nicki minaj y'all don't want me to rep y'all y'all don't hear when i rep y'all cause y'all be dickriding everybody else  charlamagne she does have a point do you feel you get the proper love from new york  nicki minaj hell fucking no  charlamagne and i never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers you did the dvds you did the mixtapes you came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in new york  nicki minaj i was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking bmw out on jamaica mutherfucking avenue to amadu and hussaine and these niggas fuck you niggas you niggas don't know the fucking half of what i've fucking been through  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne well sir isaac newton said the law of energy is energy is not lost or destroyed it is merely transferred from on party to the next you got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you you read it and now you're miserable  nicki minaj absolutely right absolutely  charlemange what you think about the blogs scaff beezy  scaff sb beezy honestly the blogs could just suck my damn cock balls deepthroat gag and choke  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne so miss nicki minaj what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like lady gaga or madonna and you're doing things for shock value  nicki minaj well i mean i don't know in a minute if i fucking sit down and piss they're going to tell me i can't do that cause another bitch did it  scaff sb beezy stupid ass bitches yo niggas just want to compare her to somebody  nicki minaj everybody if they ever see me sitting down and peeing they're gonna fucking stone me  scaff sb beezy they're gonna say you're trying to be like barack's wife look at her she's sitting down and peeing like that you trying to be like michelle  nicki minaj why you sitting down and peeing nicki  scaff sb beezy why don't you stand up  charlemange that happens to everybody though  nicki minaj it does  scaff sb beezy no nicki gets it so hard  pause hospital flow need more gauze  charlamagne i think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable  nicki minaj absolutely i always say that for their minds to interpret it they have to draw a comparison and i always say even though it's very common it's just a more simpleminded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time it is what it is but even she gets compared to madonna and it's a neverending cycle but i rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to  charlamagne someone that is washed that's a natural emotion though it's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner that's just the way that it is  do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say i did look like a damn fool  nicki minaj yes yes i do yes i do  charlemagne do you ever think that  scaff sb beezy sometimes every now and then you know what i like about superstars i like my superstars to be out there jump out the window be like prince with your ass out i may see it and say damn she looks like a fool but you're a superstar  that's how i want to see my superstars i don't want to see my superstars regular  _________________________________________________________________  nicki minaj i keep saying this i went to school for theater i took four years of my life and devoted it to theater  i did that because my passion was acting when i started rapping i felt like i couldn't really be myself when i started winning i started feeling that i can be myself i can do my accents i can do my voices i can do my faces i can do costumes  i can now bring me to who you know people see as nicki minaj i can now really bring me into it and i think that's where the confusion lies is that people thought that when i first came out that that was me in my entirety but that wasn't that was a small facet of who i was  but who you see now is just a more multifaceted mixture of all the personalities that i have in me i mean and i think that if i was to not show that then i wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like i do cause for every person who doesn't understand it is there is a person who feels like me who feels like sometimes i just break out in an english accent you know like what's wrong with that  charlemagne you can why not  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne do you think that mixtape nicki and pop nicki can exist in the same space  nicki minaj they already are they're already existing together and they are both winning  charlemagne who do you feel that you lean towards more  nicki minaj i can't choose i can't pick i feel like the world makes them two different people but in my mind they're the same person  that's what i keep saying i grew up in new york my whole life i would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend and then monday through friday i was having a ninetofive on wall street  when i was an office manager i wasn't having the same conversation in the office that i was having on the block but i was still the same person i was onika but i knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people get a job ace the interview and then go home with my home girls and have fun  charlemagne it seems like you're very versatile if it's one thing that i would love for little girls to embrace from nicki minaj is the fact that she is versatile she knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting  nicki minaj right because you can't do too much of either you really can't  it's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side when that is detrimental for your future it's detrimental for your growth it's detrimental to your longevity  at a certain point as a woman  i'm not talking about as a man because we've seen the blueprint with jay we've seen that you could come in the game and do 0  5  still win and still be the king of hip hop we have not seen that with a woman so show me the blueprint that's all i want you to do  show me the blueprint  charlemagne i think you are creating it because queen latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore she went on to become an actress  nicki minaj and is someone who i tip my hat to because queen latifah looked at it and said okay wait hmm i may not want to be 40 years old rapping the hip hop fans may not want to hear me when i'm 40 years old rapping so i'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who i am can be seen queen latifah does musicals movies voiceovers for cartoons  is she a sellout or is she winning  charlemagne she's winning  nicki minaj so these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed and they're living in you know low income housing  is that winning just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap the same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way that downloaded the shit get the fuck out of here  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne when it's all said and done are you going to want to have kids get married  nicki minaj oh my goodness i have to i have to yep i'm gonna get married and have kids i love children i am obsessed with children  and yeah i believe in marriage and i believe marriage is forever so that's the other thing  scaff sb beezy look in my eyes look in my eyes  know that we'll always be forever  moment in time moment in time  nicki minaj safaree safaree  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne do you have any regrets cause you've had a relatively short career this is the second album and hopefully we can ten more of these but do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been nicki minaj  nicki minaj i think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when i could have  charlemange how can the author of i wish i could enjoy this moment for life not be here trying to enjoy every moment  nicki minaj absolutely and that's the thing it kinda just comes so quickly  scaff sb beezy pause  nicki minaj and then all of a sudden it's like wait a minute i just did super bowl i just did super bowl with madonna and before i go into the super bowl stage i'm just stressing and worrying and then when i come off it's all done and what i did i even enjoy about it  charlemagne not even that you closed up the grammy's  scaff sb beezy but that's why cause she's doing the super bowl and she's thinking about the grammy's  nicki minaj and then i'm doing the grammy's and i'm thinking about the nba allstar game that's the only thing  i've gotten to a very good place though all of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled i used to be and every time i tell people no no i'm really good i'm really happy i'm really at a peaceful place it's almost like they don't believe me so i thought the other day i must have really really been worried a lot because people who know me very well are like are you sure you're ok but i really am i've never been this happy i'm so proud of this album i'm proud of myself and i will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential it's a scare tactic _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne what is nicki minaj's purpose because from the outside looking in i think you're a very blessed individual because you got two things going against you number one you're a female and the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping and then you're from new york there's a lot of rappers from new york that aren't popping right now so you got those two things going against you  being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are it's like she's obviously here for something i think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know but what is nicki minaj's purpose  nicki minaj i have to pray on that i think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans really i've always had this dream of having a nicki minaj ymca type of thing when i was young  well everybody knows my story  we didn't have a lot free lunch was the thing we can get free lunch oh we're going to free lunch this is like dope so i remember those moments and i always play them back in my head and i wish to think to myself i wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that  but things were moving so quickly my parents were so not really stable and just  my father being an addict and all that in a lot of ways i feel like i didn't really have a childhood so when i see kids it melts my heart because i'm looking at them and i'm like they'll never get this moment back again and they'll always remember this time how do we as adults optimize it for them right now whether they have money or not  i think that one day i would like to do something for them for kids in the inner cities for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling tutoring i remember i was really really smart in school and i think my mother took that for granted so she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push but i think that kids need that  it's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education but that's real shit i don't just say that because it sounds good i really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college  i feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain i don't feel like that ever happened most of my closest girlfriends it was just like once they got out of high school they figured oh well we're good now we're out of high school or i got my ged i'm good and i don't want my fans to think like that  i have such a great rapport with my fans when they see me they really be bringing out their bachelor's and their master's saying look nicki look because they know how important it is to me it's ok to have fun i'mma give you the raunchiest sometimes but i also want you to realize that it's for a time  one day you're going to look back and think wait a minute did i really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where i could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children  we got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child but you're having a child because i want to keep this dude or it just happened i want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that we're the ones in control again why are we never in control  why are we stuck with a baby why are we always stuck on the welfare line why are we always stuck having to beg borrow and steal to provide for our children why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby waiting until you're 5 or 6 to have children  technology has changed  you can wait have something to offer them that's something that's dear to my heart doing something that makes children feel like i don't have to rush to grow up i can enjoy my childhood i can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes that's my bigger goal in life  charlemagne how do you stay humble i know you keep a tight circle you keep guys like scaff beezy around  i'm gonna ask scaff how do you keep her humble scaff beezy do you ever see her getting a little bit extra  scaff sb beezy you wanna know what's crazy yesterday remember i was saying to you it's so crazy she's so famous if she goes out anytime we go somewhere it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie  the other day we went to a carnival we thought we'd be able to be in there and just go on some rides and nobody will notice anything within like seven minutes the whole park  it was 0 5 minutes until we got out  she really hasn't changed she really don't act like i'm this person or i'm that person she just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that it doesn't faze her she really hasn't changed a bit  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne pay attention to that how did you escape being more than just an ass  nicki minaj we said that the other day before i was just a rapping butt  safaree sb samuels a butt with lyrics  charlemagne how did you get out of that  nicki minaj because i created a brand  people take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won it's very hard mentally this shit is draining and draining for you to be able to get up there and do music that people love and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain't getting to you it's draining  it's crazy that's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics when i was coming up i never understood it i use to be like what they are so ungrateful why are they on drugs why don't they fucking appreciate their success i would kill to be where they are until you get here and you are like oh my god lord is this the price i have to pay if i really want this and he's like yep now let's see who really want it but i think i became more than that because people cannot deny at the end of the day people can't deny that  charlamagne you the shit say it you don't have to be humble be like ray j i'm tired of being humble  nicki minaj i'm not a cocky person by nature  charlemagne scaff be cocky for her  scaff sb beezy yeah yeah yeah man you bitches ain't shit man you need to just really  when you see her get the rose petals just like she's said before throw it out in front of her feet you pour out the champagne you feed her grapes if something needs to be sucked you suck it  nicki minaj what what would need to be sucked on you  scaff sb beezy ay anything anywhere i'm in these streets looking for work we're all in these streets we're looking for that work that twerk  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne i just want to tell you nicki i think that you're very necessary i think you represent something way bigger than hip hop i think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels and i think like how jayz took it to heights and made people be like damn hip hop can take you this far i think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further so keep doing your thing ma  nicki minaj thank you darling  charlemange da god singed out

 listen to the static of the radio runnin' red lights on my way back home this is what you do to me i'm getting away but i got nowhere to go your arms are uninviting and your stare is cold if this is how it's gonna be well i'm gonna let it be yeah yeah yeah  and i didn't wanna see it coming when you gave it up in the end and you were the one to let me know it's over i tried so hard but in the end i failed again  believed in every word that came through your theeth i though to myself that you meant everything 'cause that's the way you made it seem so for now i'm gonna let it go it isn't worth deeping this hole where my heart used to be so i'm gonna let it be yeah yeah yeah  and i didn't wanna see it coming when you gave it up in the end and you were the one to let me know it's over i tried so hard but in the end i failed again  you did'nt really want it you did'nt really need me nurse the wounds but they're still open from the seams watch it bleed  and i didn't wanna see it coming when you gave it up in the end and you were the one to let me know it's over i tried so hard but in the end i failed again  this isn't love but i'll pretend 
 its a perfect day the coolest breeze not a cloud in the sky casts a shade on me colours shining bright oh its so surreal and on this perfect day i got lost get me out of this confusion i'm falling apart i've got an aching heart i'm so out of place 
 and what i feel makes me break down and cry how it hurts how it multiplies it's not a temporary pain cause it sticks like glue forever so i carry on pretending i'm okay on a perfect day i'm drowning in memories throw me a lifeline don't think its my time and i can hardly breathe oh why did you have to leave on a perfect day 
 and what i feel makes me break down and cry how it hurts how it multiplies it's not a temporary pain cause it sticks like glue forever so i carry on pretending i'm okay we all know that you're not a lonely heart we can't stand the laws you're watching over us taking care of us until we meet again my friend you are everything to me and i love you for it but now you're gone and what i feel makes me break down and cry how it hurts how it multiplies and what i feel makes me break down and cry how it hurts how it multiplies it's not a temporary pain cause it sticks like glue forever so i carry on so carry on i carry on it'll be okay 
 watch you're man you should watch you're mouth

 looking at it now last december last december we were built to fall apart then fall back together back together your necklace hanging from my neck the night we couldn't quite forget when we decided we decided to move the furniture so we could dance baby like we stood a chance two paper airplanes flying flying flying and i remember thinking

 remember when you hit the brakes too soon twenty stitches in a hospital room when you started crying baby i did too but when the sun came up i was looking at you remember when we couldn't take the heat i walked out and said i'm setting you free but the monsters turned out to be just trees when the sun came up you were looking at me you were looking at me ooh you were looking at me are we out of the woods yet are we out of the woods yet are we out of the woods yet are we out of the woods i remember are we in the clear yet are we in the clear yet are we in the clear yet in the clear yet good oh i remember

 you're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset she's going off about something that you said 'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do i'm in my room it's a typical tuesday night i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like and she'll never know your story like i do  pre but she wears short skirts i wear tshirts she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time 
 if you could see that i'm the one who understands you been here all along so why can't you see you belong with me you belong with me 
 walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be laughing on a park bench thinking to myself hey isn't this easy and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down you say you're fine i know you better than that hey whatcha doing with a girl like that  pre she wears high heels i wear sneakers she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time 
 if you could see that i'm the one who understands you been here all along so why can't you see you belong with me standing by and waiting at your back door all this time how could you not know baby you belong with me you belong with me 
 oh i remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night i'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry and i know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams think i know where you belong think i know it's with me

 when she fell she fell apart cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fairweather friends  when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep whatever you say it is not right whatever you do it is not enough your kindness is fake your pain is manipulative  when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and getlovequickschemes  when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broadshouldered next to her was a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she turned to go home she heard the echoes of new words may your heart remain breakable but never by the same hand twice and even louder without your past you could never have arrived so wondrously and brutally by design or some violent exquisite happenstance here  and in the death of her reputation she felt truly alive 
 once upon a time a few mistakes ago i was in your sights you got me alone you found me you found me you found me i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that and when i fell hard you took a step back without me without me without me  pre and he's long gone when he's next to me and i realize the blame is on me

 loving him is like driving a new maserati down a deadend street faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all 
 losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red loving him was red 
 touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong 
 losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red oh red burning red 
 remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it's time now gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red loving him was red 
 oh losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met 'cause loving him was red yeah yeah red we're burning red  breakdown and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head comes back to me burning red yeah yeah 
 his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street 
 walking through a crowd the village is aglow kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats everybody here wanted something more searching for a sound we hadn't heard before and it said

 here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation 
 if you're anything like me you bite your nails and laugh when you're nervous you promise people the world because that's what they want from you you like giving them what they want but darling you need to stop  if you're anything like me you knock on wood every time you make plans you cross your fingers hold your breath wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck rest in peace to your naive bravado if life gets too good now darling it scares you  if you're anything like me you never wanted to lock your door your secret garden gate or your diary drawer didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore for fear she was much better before but darling now you have to  if you're anything like me there's a justice system in your head for names you'll never speak again and you make your ruthless rulings each new enemy turns to steel they become the bars that confine you in your own little golden prison cell but darling there is where you meet yourself  if you're anything like me you've grown to hate your pride to love your thighs and no amount of friends at 5 will fill the empty seats at the lunch tables of your past the teams that picked you last but darling you keep trying  if you're anything like me you couldn't recognize the face of your love until they stripped you of your shiny paint threw your victory flag away and you saw the ones who wanted you anyway darling later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day  if you're anything like me i'm sorry  but darling it's going to be okay

 there i was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles same old tired lonely place walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when i saw your face all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you 
 your eyes whispered have we met across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me the playful conversation starts counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy and it was enchanting to meet you all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you 
 this night is sparkling don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home i'll spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you 
 the lingering question kept me up am who do you love i wonder 'til i'm wide awake and now i'm pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door i'd open up and you would say hey it was enchanting to meet you all i know is i was enchanted to meet you 
  this night is sparkling don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home i'll spend forever wondering if you knew this night is flawless don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck dancing around all alone i'll spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you 
  
 this is me praying that this was the very first page not where the storyline ends my thoughts will echo your name until i see you again these are the words i held back as i was leaving too soon i was enchanted to meet you  breakdown please don't be in love with someone else please don't have somebody waiting on you please don't be in love with someone else please don't have somebody waiting on you 
  this night is sparkling don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home i'll spend forever wondering if you knew this night is flawless don't you let it go i'm wonderstruck dancing around all alone i'll spend forever wondering if you knew i was enchanted to meet you 
 please don't be in love with someone else please don't have somebody waiting on you 
 i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 58 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away 
 i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july 9th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms 
 but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips 
 i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party you're showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i'm not much for dancing but for you i did  4 because i love your handshake meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions 
 and i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss i never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips ooh 
 so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind 
 so i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips 
 just like our last

 i was reminiscing just the other day while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away back to a firstglance feeling on new york time back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme took off faster than a green light go hey you skip the conversation when you already know i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made and that was the first day 
 and darling it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground 
 spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you and for the first time i had something to lose and i guess we fell apart in the usual way and the story's got dust on every page but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now and i see your face in every crowd 
 'cause darling it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground 
 tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you 
 it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground 
 tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you 
 you were in college working parttime waiting tables left a small town and never looked back i was a flight risk with a fear of falling wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  pre  i say can you believe it as we're lying on the couch the moment i could see it yes yes i can see it now 
 do you remember we were sitting there by the water you put your arm around me for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine 
 flash forward and we're taking on the world together and there's a drawer of my things at your place you learn my secrets and figure out why i'm guarded you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  pre  but we got bills to pay we got nothing figured out when it was hard to take yes yes this is what i thought about 
 do you remember we were sitting there by the water you put your arm around me for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine  do you remember all the city lights on the water you saw me start to believe for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine 
 and i remember that fight 0 am as everything was slipping right out of our hands i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street braced myself for the goodbye 'cause that's all i've ever known then you took me by surprise you said i'll never leave you alone 
  you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water and every time i look at you it's like the first time i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter she is the best thing that's ever been mine hold on make it last hold on never turn back you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine 
 yeah yeah do you believe it hold on we're gonna make it now hold on and i can see it yeah yeah i can see it now see it now 
 put your lips close to mine as long as they don't touch out of focus eye to eye 'til the gravity's too much and i'll do anything you say if you say it with your hands and i'd be smart to walk away but you're quicksand 
  this slope is treacherous this path is reckless this slope is treacherous and iii like it 
 i can't decide if it's a choice getting swept away i hear the sound of my own voice asking you to stay and all we are is skin and bone trained to get along forever going with the flow but you're friction 
  this slope is treacherous this path is reckless this slope is treacherous and i i i like it 
 two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will get you get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home 
  this hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous this hope is treacherous iii iii iii  breakdown two headlights shine through the sleepless night and i will get you get you alone your name has echoed through my mind and i just think you should think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home i'll follow you follow you home follow you follow you home 
 this slope is treacherous iii like it 
 i'm so glad you made time to see me how's life tell me how's your family i haven't seen them in a while you've been good busier than ever we small talk work and the weather your guard is up and i know why  pre because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind you gave me roses and i left them there to die 
 so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december all the time it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine  post i'd go back to december turn around and make it alright i go back to december all the time 
 these days i haven't been sleeping staying up playing back myself leaving when your birthday passed and i didn't call and i think about summer all the beautiful times i watched you laughing from the passenger side and realized i loved you in the fall  pre and then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye 
 so this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december all the time it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine  post i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time 
 i miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right and how you held me in your arms that september night the first time you ever saw me cry maybe this is wishful thinking probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right i'd go back in time and change it but i can't so if the chain is on your door i understand 
 but this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night and i'd go back to december it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine  post i'd go back to december turn around and make it alright i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind i go back to december all the time

 you should've been there should've burst through the door with that baby i'm right here smile and it would've felt like a million little shining stars had just aligned and i would've been so happy 
 christmas lights glisten i've got my eye on the door just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking people ask me how i've been as i comb back through my memory how you said you'd be here you said you'd be here 
 and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing as i'm looking around the room but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew 
 and the hours pass by now i just wanna be alone but your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong so they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom i try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts as i say hopelessly he said he'd be here 
 and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing and asking me about you but there was one thing missing missing and that was the moment i knew 
 what do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of everyone you know and what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who didn't show  breakdown you should've been here and i would've been so happy 
 and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all standing around me singing happy birthday to you but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew ohohohohohohoh i knew ohohohohohohoh 
 you called me later and said i'm sorry i didn't make it and i said i'm sorry too and that was the moment i knew 
 you with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again got me feeling like i'm nothing you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when i'm wounded you picking on the weaker man  pre well you can take me down with just one single blow but you don't know what you don't know 
 someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean 
 you with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again as if i don't already see them i walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you i just wanna feel okay again  pre i bet you got pushed around somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 'cause you can't lead me down that road and you don't know what you don't know 
 someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean 
 and i can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game with that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing but all you are is mean all you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life and mean and mean and mean and mean  breakdown but someday i'll be living in a big old city and all you're ever gonna be is mean yeah 
 someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean someday i'll be living in a big old city why you gotta be so mean and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me why you gotta be so mean and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean

 you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors it's the morning of your very first day you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while try and stay out of everybody's way it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here for the next four years in this town hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say you know i haven't seen you around before 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them and when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out well count to ten take it in this is life before you know who you're gonna be fifteen 
 you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail and soon enough you're best friends laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool we'll be outta here as soon as we can and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying and your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends when the night ends 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them and when you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team but i didn't know it at fifteen 
 when all you wanted was to be wanted wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday but i realized some bigger dreams of mine and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind and we both cried 
 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them and when you're fifteen don't forget to look before you fall i've found time can heal most anything and you just might find who you're supposed to be i didn't know who i was supposed to be at fifteen  post la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 your very first day take a deep breath girl take a deep breath as you walk through the doors 
 the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and i'm a house of cards you're the kind of reckless that should send me running but i kinda know that i won't get far and you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinking of 
 drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

 drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile

 our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date man i didn't kiss her and i should have and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again 
 i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day had gone all wrong and been trampled on and lost and thrown away got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed i almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said 
 our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date man i didn't kiss her and i should have and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again

 'cause our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late tapping on his window when we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'cause it's late and his mama don't know our song is the way he laughs the first date man i didn't kiss him and i should have and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again play it again

 i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly and people would say they're the lucky ones i used to know my place was a spot next to you now i'm searching the room for an empty seat 'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on  pre  oh a simple complication miscommunications lead to fallout so many things that i wish you knew so many walls up i can't break through 
 now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah i don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter 
 how'd we end up this way see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy and you're doing your best to avoid me i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us of how i was losing my mind when i saw you here but you held your pride like you should've held me  pre  oh i'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how i've never heard silence quite this loud 
 now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah and i don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

 once upon a time i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye and we caught onto something i hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me were you just kidding 'cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down we almost never speak i don't feel welcome anymore baby what happened please tell me 'cause one second it was perfect now you're halfway out the door  pre and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all and you flashback to when he said forever and always 
 oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'cause i was there when you said forever and always 
 was i out of line did i say something way too honest made you run and hide like a scared little boy i looked into your eyes thought i knew you for a minute now i'm not so sure so here's to everything coming down to nothing here's to silence that cuts me to the core where is this going thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore  pre and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all and you flashback to when he said forever and always 
 oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'cause i was there when you said forever and always you didn't mean it baby i don't think so 
 oh back up baby back up did you forget everything back up baby back up did you forget everything 
 'cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'cause i was there when you said forever and always oh i stare at the phone he still hasn't called and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all and you flashback to when we said forever and always and  it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'cause i was there when you said forever and always you didn't mean it baby you said forever and always yeah 
 elevator buttons and morning air strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs seems like there's always someone who disapproves they'll judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury's out but my choice is you 
 so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours 
 you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine 
 and you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours 
 and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  breakdown 'cause i love the gap between your teeth and i love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'cause my heart is yours 
 so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine but they can't take what's ours they can't take what's ours 
 the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours 
 he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said that's a lie just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin' stuck on backroads at night and i was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone 
 but when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me 
 september saw a month of tears and thankin' god that you weren't here to see me like that but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read from three summers back it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet and lookin' back on all of that it's nice to believe 
 when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me 
 and i'm back for the first time since then i'm standin' on your street and there's a letter left on your doorstep and the first thing that you'll read is when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song someday you'll turn your radio on i hope it takes you back to that place 
 when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me oh think of me mmmm

 i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl 
 i sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  pre this is surely not what you thought it would be i lose myself in a daydream where i stand and say 
 don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now 
 fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march and i am hiding in the curtains it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe  pre she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen but i know you wish it was me you wish it was me don't you 
 don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now 
 don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow your time is running out and they said speak now  interlude ooh ladadada oh ooh ooh say a single vow 
 i hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace there's the silence there's my last chance i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me horrified looks from everyone in the room but i'm only looking at you 
 i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl hehe 
 so don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now 
  variation and you say let's run away now i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door baby i didn't say my vows so glad you were around when they said speak now 
 i think i think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes you know it's like a kaleidoscope of memories it just all comes back but he never does i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen it's not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along with it and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again but i don't know if i should i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright but i just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you maybe he knew that when he saw me i guess i just lost my balance i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him it was losing me 
 your little hand's wrapped around my finger and it's so quiet in the world tonight your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming so i tuck you in turn on your favorite night light to you everything's funny you got nothing to regret i'd give all i have honey if you could stay like that 
 oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up just stay this little oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up it could stay this simple i won't let nobody hurt you won't let no one break your heart and no one will desert you just try to never grow up never grow up 
 you're in the car on the way to the movies and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off at fourteen there's just so much you can't do and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots but don't make her drop you off around the block remember that she's getting older too and don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school 
 oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up just stay this little oh darling don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up it could stay this simple no one's ever burned you nothing's ever left you scarred and even though you want to just try to never grow up 
 take pictures in your mind of your childhood room memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home remember the footsteps remember the words said and all your little brother's favorite songs i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone so here i am in my new apartment in a big city they just dropped me off it's so much colder than i thought it would be so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on wish i'd never grown up i wish i'd never grown up

 last night i heard my own heart beating sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and i'm still reaching even though i know you're not there i was playing back a thousand memories baby thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through maybe i've been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you 
 come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now 
 i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing 'cause nothing like this ever happened to them now i'm pacing down the hall chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me nothing's gonna change not for me and you not before i knew how much i had to lose 
 come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now 
 if you're out there if you're somewhere if you're moving on i've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just want to see you back at my front door 
  variation and i say come back come back come back to me like you would before you said it's not that easy before the fight before i locked you out but i take it all back now

 i'm five years old it's getting cold i've got my big coat on i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you i run and run past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides look now the sky is gold i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 
 i don't know why all the trees change in the fall but i know you're not scared of anything at all don't know if snow white's house is near or far away but i know i had the best day with you today 
 i'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names 
 i don't know who i'm going to talk to now at school but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay but i know i had the best day with you today

 you don't have to call anymore i won't pick up the phone this is the last straw don't wanna hurt anymore and you can tell me that you're sorry but i don't believe you baby like i did before you're not sorry no no no no 
 you're looking so innocent i might believe you if i didn't know could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold and you've got your share of secrets and i'm tired of being last to know and now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

 don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that 
 i don't even know her but i feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right it's kinda like a code yeah and you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines  pre and it would be a fine proposition if i was a stupid girl but honey i am no one's exception this i have previously learned 
 so don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that i see you turn off your phone and now you've got me alone and i say don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that 
 i just want to make sure you understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad while she waits up you chase down the newest thing and take for granted what you have  pre and it would be a fine proposition if i was a stupid girl and yeah i might go with it if i hadn't once been just like her 
 so don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that i see you turn off your phone and now you've got me alone and i say don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh 
 call a cab lose my number you're about to lose your girl call a cab lose my number let's consider this lesson learned 
 don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that want to see you pick up your phone and tell her you're coming home don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that 
 don't look at me you got a girl at home and everybody knows that everybody knows that it would be a fine proposition if i hadn't once been just like her 
 you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take you take the very best of me so i start a fight cause i need to feel something and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted 
 oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there loving you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you 
 oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died died for you died for you 
 oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you 
 untouchable like a distant diamond sky i'm reaching out and i just can't tell you why i'm caught up in you i'm caught up in you  pre untouchable burning brighter than the sun and when you're close i feel like coming undone 
 in the middle of the night when i'm in this dream it's like a million little stars spelling out your name you got to come on come on say that we'll be together come on come on little taste of heaven 
 it's half full and i won't wait here all day i know you're saying that you'd be here anyway  pre but you're untouchable burning brighter than the sun now that you're close i feel like coming undone 
 in the middle of the night when i'm in this dream it's like a million little stars spelling out your name you got to come on come on say that we'll be together come on come on oh in the middle of the night waking from this dream i want to feel you by my side standing next to me you got to come on come on say that we'll be together come on come on little taste of heaven

 seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back at you you walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true 'cause i know you 
 hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone 
 i guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh 'cause it's not his price to pay it's not his price to pay 
 hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone hold on baby you're losing it the water's high you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone 
 you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone oh goodbye baby with a smile baby baby 
 i remember your bare feet down the hallway i remember your little laugh race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs i love you to the moon and back  i remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club i remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  i can still feel you hold my hand little man and even the moment i knew you fought it hard like an army guy remember i leaned in and whispered to you 
 come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here you were my best four years 
 i remember the drive home when the blind hope turned to crying and screaming why flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  and it's about to be halloween you could be anything you wanted if you were still here i remember the last day when i kissed your face i whispered in your ear 
 come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here out of this curtain room and this hospital grey we'll just disappear come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here you were my best four years 
 what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you what if i kept the handmedowns you won't grow into and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you 
 come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here you were my best four years 
 i remember your bare feet down the hallway i love you to the moon and back 
 she said i was seven and you were nine i looked at you like the stars that shined in the sky the pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my 
  take me back to the house in the backyard tree said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me you never did you never did take me back when our world was one block wide i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried just two kids you and i oh my my my my 
 well i was sixteen when suddenly i wasn't that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us they never believed we'd really fall in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my 
  take me back to the creek beds we turned up two am riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me take me back to the time we had our very first fight the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight you stayed outside till the morning light oh my my my my 
 a few years had gone and come around we were sitting at our favorite spot in town and you looked at me got down on one knee 
  take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle our whole town came and our mamas cried you said i do and i did too take me home where we met so many years before we'll rock our babies on that very front porch after all this time you and i 
 i'll be eightyseven you'll be eightynine i'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky oh my my my 
 so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it 
 and it's a sad picture the final blow hits you somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know it's all the same another time and place repeating history and you're getting sick of it but i believe in whatever you do and i'll do anything to see it through 
 because these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah oh oh 
 so we've been outnumbered raided and now cornered it's hard to fight when the fight aint fair we're getting stronger now finding things they never found they might be bigger but we're faster and never scared you can walk away say we don't need this but there's something in your eyes says we can beat this 
 'cause these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah oh oh 
 tonight we stand get off our knees fight for what we've worked for all these years and the battle was long it's the fight of our lives but we'll stand up champions tonight 
 it was the night things changed can you see it now these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down it's a revolution throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in and we'll sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah hallelujah

 i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me when i'm with you 
 just a small town boy and girl living in a crazy world tryna figure out what is and isn't true and i don't try to hide my tears my secrets or my deepest fears through it all nobody gets me like you do and you know everything about me you say that you can't live without me 
 i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me when i'm with you 
 when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself and only you can tell 
 that i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well you drive me crazy half the time the other half i'm only tryna let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me who i wanna be well i'm only me when i'm with you with you

 you're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know you're really gonna be someone ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life will lead you back to my door oh but if it don't stay beautiful 
 corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day i'm taking pictures in my mind so i can save them for a rainy day it's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away i should say hey by the way 
 you're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know you're really gonna be someone ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life will lead you back to my door oh but if it don't stay beautiful

 i'd never gone with the wind just let it flow let it take me where it wants to go til you open the door there's so much more i'd never seen it before i was trying to fly but i couldn't find wings but you came along and you changed everything 
 you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier 
 i've watched from a distance as you made life your own every sky was your own kind of blue and i wanted to know how that would feel and you made it so real you showed me something that i couldn't see you opened my eyes and you made me believe 
 you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier oh

 you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier 
 in the heat of the fight i walked away ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay i said this time i've had enough and you've called a hundred times but i'm not picking up 'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over but if you look a little closer 
 i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door 
 me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone going through the photographs staring at the phone i keep going back over things we both said and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread so babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see when i left i wanted you to chase after me 
 yeah i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door

 i said leave but baby all i want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door 
 with your face and the beautiful eyes and the conversation with the little white lies and the faded picture of a beautiful night you carried me from your car up the stairs and i broke down crying was she worth this mess after everything and that little black dress after everything i must confess i need you 
 i didn't know what i would find when i went looking for a reason i know i didn't read between the lines and baby i've got nowhere to go i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times am i right 
 so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside 
 you saw me there but never knew i would give it all up to be a part of this a part of you and now it's all too late so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until it's too late to do anything 
 so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside 
 oh yeah 
 so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside

 she can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile she'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by  pre and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her but you are everything to me 
 and i just wanna show you she don't even know you she's never gonna love you like i want to and you just see right through me but if you only knew me we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable instead of just invisible 
 there's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through she's never gonna see the light no matter what you do  pre and all i think about is how to make you think of me and everything that we could be 
 i just wanna show you she don't even know you she's never gonna love you like i want to and you just see right through me if you only knew me we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable instead of just invisible

  variation i just wanna show you she don't even know you baby let me love you let me want you you just see right through me but if you only knew me we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable instead of just invisible 
 she can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile 
 i don't know what i want so don't ask me cause i'm still trying to figure it out don't know what's down this road i'm just walking trying to see through the rain coming down even though i'm not the only one who feels the way i do 
 i'm alone on my own and that's all i know i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world 
 got the radio on my old blue jeans and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve feeling lucky today got the sunshine could you tell me what more do i need and tomorrow's just a mystery oh yeah but that's ok 
 i'm alone on my own and that's all i know i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

 i had to catch my breath when i saw you there across the room holding her hand i'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you but here i am still believing there might come a day we'll pick up where we left off 
 and by the way your eyes are dancing i'd say the chances of that are getting slim by the way my heart's still breaking it's going to take it a while to love again so many things that i forgot to say by the way 
 i should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive i guess it's too late so i'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night give you one last wave maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say i'm looking good 
 but by the way your eyes are dancing i'd say the chances of that are getting slim by the way my heart's still breaking it's going to take it a while to love again so many things that i forgot to say 
 by the way you still look amazing and i must've been crazy to let you get away by the way if you ever wondered still got the same old number just in case i still miss you and i still love you by the way by the way oh 
 angelinas got a pretty face and really long brown hair lives somewhere in some wide open space ive never been there i guess some people come around and purpose she but i dont cause 
 i have always been a bit reckless and i am not your typical princess im fine just a bit of a mess and im not perfect you could say i wasnt brought up that way  just watched stephen run across the field watched him catch the ball hes got everything youd wanna be hes funny dark and tall watch him run across to angelina but i wont cause

 i have always been a bit reckless and i am not your typical princess im fine just a bit of a mess and im not perfect you could say i wasnt brought up that way 
 beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere tangled like the roots on the ground the windows opened up the wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound its like im melting on into you give me a reason why we should ever move and 
 tell me youll never leave me and im not crazy and this is really happening that this is really happening 
 could this be better you write me letters so you see me every day you tend to treat me like my name is up in lights it really blows me away  lock me up in a dark room and i still cant take my eyes off you 
 tell me youll never leave me and im not crazy and this is really happening that this is really happening 
 all those kisses up against your car for all those wishes on planes we thought were stars memories like photographs oh baby here we are 
 tell me youll never leave me and im not crazy and oh this is really happening oh oh baby 
 tell me youll always need me that i drive you crazy and this is really happening oh that this is really happening 
 tell me oh youll always need me need me tell me baby that i drive you crazy oh that this is really happening

 let go of the ones who hurt you let go of the ones you outgrow let go of the words they hurl your way as youre walking out the door the only thing cut and dry in this hedgemaze life is the fact that their words will cut but your tears will dry  they dont tell you this when you are young you cant hold on to everything cant show up for everyone you pick your poison or your cure phone numbers you know by heart and the ones you dont answer any more  hold on to the faint recognition in the eye of a stranger as it catches you in its lustrous net how quickly we become intertwined how wonderful it is to forget all the times your intuition failed you but it hasnt killed you yet hold on to childlike whims and moonlight swims and your blazing selfrespect  and if you drive the roads of this town ones youve gone down so many times before flashback to all the times life nearly ran you off the road but tonight your hand is steady suddenly youll know the trick to holding on was all that letting go 
 please take down the mistletoe 'cause i don't want to think about that right now 'cause everything i want is miles away in a snow covered little town my momma's in the kitchen worrying about me season's greetings hope you're well well i'm doing alright if you were wondering lately i can never tell 
 i know this shouldn't be a lonely time but there were christmases when you were mine 
 i've been doing fine without you really up until the nights got cold and everybody's here except you baby seems like everyone's got someone to hold 
 but for me it's just a lonely time 'cause there were christmases when you were mine 
 merry christmas everybody that'll have to be something i just say this year i'll bet you got your mom another sweater and were your cousins late again when you were putting up the lights this year did you notice one less pair of hands 
 i know this shouldn't be a lonely time but there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight 'cause there were christmases when you were mine 
 you were mine 
 i bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind wondering if you'll ever find just what you want a hometown number one or a california loaded gun but you know you only get one or that's what you thought but here's what you've got 
 i could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer i could be your little beauty queen just a little outta reach or the girl living next door i'll be your angel giving up her wings if that's what you need i'd give everything to be your anything 
 if you want hard to get if you want all you have to do is let me know if you want a bumpy ride or someone with a softer side either one will be alright just let me know cause this is where it goes 
   it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you but for someone like you it's just so easy to do 
 i could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees in the bottom of the top drawer i could be your little beauty queen just a little outta reach or the girl living next door i'll be your angel giving up her wings if that's what you need  if that's what you need 
 i wake up i stretch out i wonder what you're doin' right now yeah i slept in my makeup again tell myself 'i must be crazy' thinkin' 'bout him i find myself something decent to wear take the towel out of my hair about that time you call me and i'm reminded without you 
 i'd be a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote 
 i go to work work all day i'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say walk to the car dig out my keys start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me 
 i'm a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote 
 there you are on the street just standing there waiting on me i show you my new shoes you say you love them 'nd baby without you 
  i'm a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote 
 i wake up i stretch out i wonder what you're doin' right now 
 sometimes i wonder how it's going to feel will my first love be true and real will i be ready when my heart starts to fall what will i do when my love comes to call and my daddy tells me that i light up his world everyday he says darling you're my best girl he tried to teach me from the very start the meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart 
 will my love come in a bowl of fire will it be filled with hope and desire will my love come in a pouring rain am i ready for the joy am i ready for the pain am i ready for the boy am i ready for love 
 i know i'm not a little girl anymore cause i'm feeling things i've never felt before sweet sensations and anticipations calling commotion to my emotions and i hear the words my daddy said to me he said be true  yourself  keep your spirit free and love will find you one way or another be good to yourself and be good to each other 
   it's a run around the world and it's moving so fast though i want to find a love that's going to last a love so strong that i can withstand the weight of the world in the palm of its hand 
 will my love come in a bowl of fire will it be filled with hope and desire will my love come in a pouring rain am i ready for the joy am i ready for the pain am i ready for the boy am i ready for this game am i ready for the kiss am i ready for the stars am i ready for the bliss am i ready for love 
 it was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday but now who are you i thought i knew your eyes know how to look right through me it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me they weren't true it's like it wasn't you  could you tell me what did i do because it can't be we're already through did you sell me out for a fool after you held me is that just what you do what did you need from me tell me  take time to realise i know that people change their minds but that was something i wished you would say to my face but you ran away  could you tell me what did i do because it can't be we're already through did you sell me out for a fool after you held me is that just what you do what did you need from me tell me  if i had a reason or a simple goodbye baby even a lie yeah yeah  tell me what did i do because baby suddenly we're already through did you sell me out for a fool after you held me is that just what you do what did you need from me tell me and tell me  oooh yeah tell me tell me 
 let me know how's it feel to be under my skin wrapped around my heart is it like anywhere you've been and everything i do i do it just for you 
 so why the hell don't you love me why the hell don't you need me like i need you why you so far above me don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do but i was just a toy which you destroyed stupid boy 
 i have been looking in trying to read your mind give you the benefit of the doubt every single time and then you walk right by i'm screaming out inside

 ooh life's so sweet right here ooh keeping it young and crazy ooh just want to stay right here ooh hanging with my baby hanging with my baby my baby 
 it started with imagery visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity  stars drawn around scars a cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later battleships sinking into the ocean down down down the tree swing in the woods of my childhood hushed tones of let's run away and never doing it the sun drenched month of august sipped away like a bottle of wine a mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor a whiskey bottle beckoning hands held through plastic a single thread that for better or for worse ties you to your fate  pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters i found myself not only writing my own stories but also writing about or from the perspective of people i've never met people i've known or those i wish i hadn't an exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own wondering how it all went so terribly terribly wrong an embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession a seventeenyearold standing on a porch learning to apologize lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen high line my grandfather dean landing at guadalcanal in 94 a misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out  a tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around sometimes even sung about the lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible speculation over time becomes fact myths ghost stories and fables fairytales and parables gossip and legend someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold  in isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy history and memory i've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love wonder and whimsy they deserve  now it's up to you to pass them down 
 you belong with me our song  tell me why  teardrops on my

  i've seen a million things spoke a million words now i only want to speak to you waiting for the words counting every bird there's nothing i'd rather do on the smokey black nights 
 still through the haze i can make out constellations i'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand and i saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 
  i've played a thousand songs sang a thousand words now i only want to sing to you waited on a wire staring at the fire there's nothing i'd rather do on the smokey black nights 
  i've walked a thousand miles smiled a thousand smiles now i only smile when i'm with you waiting for the words counting every bird there's nothing i'd rather do on the smokey black nights 
 so walk with me as the sweet wind dances i'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights

 where will the music industry be in 0 years 0 years 50 years  before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingit's just coming alive  there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently  in recent years you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it  music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it's my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is i hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  arrows through the heart  in mentioning album sales i'd like to point out that people are still buying albums but now they're buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone it isn't as easy today as it was 0 years ago to have a multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us  there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans  in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be  there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie it's part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram  fan power  a friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to 005 when i walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around  another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me that's incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool  this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  celebrity spotlight  i predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s '80s and '90s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect i'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to  and as for me i'll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  and i'd also like a nice garden 
 my momma stood across the room face to face but never eye to eye recalling words we said the battle that we swore we'd never fight breaking pieces off with every lie a tear came to her eye and she said 
 don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you block me out tonight honey where are you and don't hate me for loving you 
 he walked around my life and made blind with every single move he caught me staring at him mad about him little that i knew love is different when you play the fool and all i want to do is say 
 don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you make cry tonight like you always do and don't hate me for loving you 
 i slammed the door sat on the floor cried into my bed said are you there do you even care to cross above my head but someone said 
 don't turn away now and don't rip my heart out things are meant to happen like this i know it's right for you and don't hate me for loving you 
 i looked up at the sky face to face and finally eye to eye 
 stumble up the porch step you sat down in the car only thirteen blocks across this town to get to where you are and that dont offer me much time to make up my mind so i best be driving slow on my way to letting go 
 these headlights they just wanna fade off into the night but if theyre half as stubborn as me theyll just keep on shining bright i aint ever been one to settle like the dust does on the dash since the feeling aint strong ill just move on and leave this in my past 
  once you're gone i know your memory'll somehow get the best of me so i question everything i do unsure of turning you away wondering love how ill act today until you find somebody new so ive been holding on way too long but not another minute i'm gonna miss you bad but cant call it love if you aint in it 
  red light turns to green then back to red again i wish there were some other travelers out here to slow my travelling even though the wheel rolled on inside i still dont know oh and it troubles me so 
  once you're gone i know your memory'll somehow get the best of me so i question everything i do unsure of turning you away wondering love how ill feel today i see you found somebody new and ive been holding on way too long but not another minute i might miss you bad but cant call it love if you aint in it  repeat 
  your car comes to a rest in the drive you open up the door and i see you smile 
 here i am once again in your driveway thinking i should be leaving i should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing you went and got to me like the stupid song on the radio that you try to forget but it sticks in your head so goodbye it's not goodnight cause i'll be seeing you in my dreamin' 
 boy you got me like a shot to the heart got me shakin' so bad spilled my coffee in the car caught a red light i ran right through gotta call my friends tell them all about you always looking like one of those nights when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light you got me you do 
 in a daze pull the shades close my eyes and picture you at my window i relax i go back to all the things you said that only i know 
 boy you got me like a shot to the heart got me shakin' so bad spilled my coffee in the car caught a red light i ran right through gotta call my friends tell them all about you always looking like one of those nights when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light you got me you do 
 i'm runnin' right out to my car and i pull out the drive it's only been ten minutes but i have to see you one more time 
 boy you got me like a shot to the heart got me shakin' so bad spilled my coffee in the car caught a red light i ran right through gotta call my friends tell them all about you always looking like one of those nights when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light you got me you do 
 i know we've got a lot to say between now and forever but i'd be a game if you would play and my dear you get better  all throughout the day you smile and walk away all i can think to do is follow you 
 if you leave i'll be crawling back for more if you need love i'll be standing at your door i'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure 
 wherever you think i am tonight just know we're miles from a heartbreak because in the blink of a pretty brown eye i'll be right where you are baby  sometime along the way you take my breath away distracted by he view i fall right into you 
 and if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more and if you ever need love i'll be standing at your door i'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure 
 they say i need to see all the people out there waiting but you take one look at me and i know the mistake i'd be making 
 becasue if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more and if you ever need love i'm standing at your door i'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure 
 i know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

 someone struck a match against the night all i could see was you and i i was captivated a perfect little dream inside my head and then reality crept in and erased it  pre for a while i thought that i could hold you but you were just a temporary high 
 firefly you drew me to you your beauty shines and lights up the sky and you don't know it do you i wish i could keep you firefly firefly 
 something so beautiful and free was as never meant to be caged in i thought i had you in my hand i tried to catch you but i can't chase the wind  pre and just as i reach out to touch you i remind myself you were meant to fly 
 firefly you drew me to you your beauty shines and lights up the sky and you don't know it do you i wish i could keep you firefly firefly 
 i like to think i'd be all that you wanted not even that is enough 
 firefly you drew me to you your beauty shines and lights up the sky and you don't know it do you i wish i could keep you firefly firefly 
 i heard a song tonight on the radio another girl sings about a boy just sees his face in every space in every room and i know that if i turn around you won't be there if i close my eyes will you be there 
 i don't want to lose your face and i don't want to wake one day and not remember what time erased and i don't want to turn around because im not scared of what love gave me and took away and i don't want to lose your face 
 i've got a picture of you in my bedroom and i hope it never falls and i hope i never lose that feeling i used to get when you would call and now i wonder to myself who were you and where are you were you ever here at all 
 i don't want to lose your face and i don't want to wake one day and not remember what time erased and i don't want to turn around because im not scared of what love gave me and took away and i don't want to lose your face 
 that girl in the song had it so good i wish i could close my eyes and see you i wish the sky had your face and the oceans had your eyes and the sunset had your lips and i had you 
 i don't want to lose your face and i don't want to wake one day and not remember what time erased and i don't want to turn around because im not scared of what love gave me and took away and i don't want to lose your face 
 i think of you every single evening as i lay awake at night i try to think try to walk away with youme in and i say

 snap buttons on a denim shirt blue jeans and a little dirt thats the closest youll see me feet hanging out a pickup truck crazy and a little rough running free thats the closest to a cowboy youll see me 
 before i met him i was so sane and grounded before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window i learned the dirt roads and i got my heart broken cause that cowboy taught me how to cry and how to let go i thought there for a little while every sunset id be a riding off with him 
 snap buttons on a denim shirt blue jeans and a little dirt thats the closest youll see me feet hanging out a pickup truck crazy and a little rough running free thats the closest to a cowboy youll see me 
 it was all a little wonderful and strange but ill never look at a sunset the same night 
 snap buttons on a denim shirt blue jeans and a little dirt thats the closest youll see me feet hanging out a pickup truck crazy and a little rough running free sitting fishing by the river bank swimming in the water tank thats the closest youll see me feet hanging out a pickup truck crazy and a little rough running free thats the closest to a cowboy youll see me 
 there's a little girl in this little town with a little too much heart to go around live forever never say never you could do better that's what she says 
 mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you 
 she sings her little song she walks along a little pathway headed for the skies left to travels lives they unravel mind over matter that's what she says 
 mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you lucky you 
 maybe she'll sing you do do do do maybe she'll bring you into the skies honey she'll love you funny how some view angels above you arent so far away 
 mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you 
 time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door but mama's watch is ticking off the wall jillian and bobby think that they're a perfect pair but girls could say he's just a bit too tall  you don't have to do to win big you just have to think it some folks say the glass is half full others choose to drink it  some say the grass could be greener and the other side ain't far away but i say the old could be newer and love still counts when it doesn't stay some say i love you some say love needs proof it's all in your point of view  he hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes his nfl was turned to tlc baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know but they all do and wish that she could see  you don't have to do to win big you just have to think it some folks say the glass is half full others choose to drink it  some say the grass could be greener and the other side ain't far away but i say the old could be newer and love still counts when it doesn't stay some say i love you some say love needs proof it's all in your point of view  in the least or masterpiece depends on one's opinion worst of all they never call but don't think that they weren't wishing  some say the grass could be greener and the other side ain't far away but i say the old could be newer and love still counts when it doesn't stay some say i love you some say love needs proof it's all in your point of view  it's all in your point of view point of view it's all in your point of view

 i walk in here with a beat up case the same  i've always played and the words i wrote down on a page when i was  years old a small town raised you tell the crowd you're paying dues i tell them this is what i do and its what i put my life into as i breathe the smoke and cheap perfume  and say life on musical road is rough conditions but the easy ride was never my ambition  hook i want to talk about what you are that i arent let's talk about what you do that i can't let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins let's talk about what you did to get here let's talk about blood and sweat and tears let's talk about what you want to be and who i've always been

 i got a lying smile i never put out for you cause i guess i never felt like i really needed to and they say little girls have big dreams and nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you 
 and it was a long time coming i waited half my life just to find someone like you i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out not knowing it'd be a long time going 
 they say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all and i say whoever said that didn't have too far to fall and they say little girls are so naive that wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you 
 and it was a long time coming i waited half my life just to find someone like you i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out not knowing it will be a long time going 
 i've burned my s had sleepless nights washed my sins on the neon lights and i'm still not over you 
 and it was a long time coming i waited half my life just to find someone like you i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out not knowing it will be a long time going  a long time going  and it will be a long time long time going ohoh ohoh oh  it will be a long time long time going going ohoh ohoh oh 
 well she was an american girl raised on promises she couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else  after all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to and if she had to die trying she had one little promise she was going to keep 
 oh yeah all right take it easy baby make it last all night she was an american girl 
 well it was kind of cold that night she stood alone on her balcony she could see the cars roll by out on 44 like waves crashing on the beach  and for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory god it's so painful it's something that's so close but still so far out of reach 
 oh yeah all right take it easy baby make it last all night she was an american girl 
 oh yeah all right take it easy baby make it last all night oh yeah all right take it easy baby oh take it easy now

 throwing pennies at the fountain when you're standing on a mountain it's kind of hard to aim  like the tree we carved our names in there must be an explanation guess it didn't get enough rain i need reasons why you're leaving 
 well i guess i wished on a plane i thought it was a star i guess what you wrote on paper wasn't written on your heart could've sworn you said you loved me i guess i heard you wrong and i guess i wished on a plane that i thought was a star 
 diving off into the deep end honestly believed you'd be there when i jumped in guess it ain't your territory we had the perfect love story except the ending nothing comes true when it comes to you oh 
 well i guess i wished on a plane i thought it was a star i guess what you wrote on paper wasn't written in your heart could've sworn you said you loved me i guess i heard you wrong and i guess i wished on a plane that i thought was a star 
 the night was so cloudy it's not my fault i just couldn't see 
 and i guess i wished on a plane i thought it was a star guess what you wrote on paper wasn't written in your heart could've sworn you said you loved me i guess i heard you wrong and i guess i wished on a plane that i thought was a star 
 throwing pennies at the fountain when you're standing on a mountain it's kind of hard to aim 
 like one of those fireflies oh it looks so good till it's in your hand it's like one of those memories where you can't let go but you just can't stand it's like one of those crazy dreams and the permanent screens in the magazines saying why'd i love all it does is break your heart 
 one morning does it all add up or am i just standing on the edge of crazy you're getting close to giving up in a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time love or lie live or die i well i guess that's life 
 like one of those people with the beautiful eyes and the perfect face it's like one of those stories where the hero dies in the very last race like one of those endless cries and the crazy lies of a hurting child saying why did love have to hurt it broke my heart 
 one morning does it all add up or am i just standing on the edge of crazy you're getting close to giving up in a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time love or lie live or die i well i guess that's life 
 i always liked to think that i was always brave enough to try to master any push and shove well i guess i never qualified love 
 one morning does it all add up or am i just standing on the edge of crazy you're getting close to giving up in a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time love or lie live or die i well i guess that's life  oh i guess that's life well i guess that's life 
 step one you say we need to talk he walks you say sit down it's just a talk he smiles politely back at you you stare politely right on through some sort of window to your right as he goes left and you stay right between the lines of fear and blame you begin to wonder why you came 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 let him know that you know best 'cause after all you do know best try to slip past his defense without granting innocence lay down a list of what is wrong the things you've told him all along pray to god he hears you and i pray to god he hears you 
 and where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 as he begins to raise his voice you lower yours and grant him one last choice drive until you lose the road or break with the ones you've followed he will do one of two things he will admit to everything or he'll say he's just not the same and you'll begin to wonder why you came 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life

 lyrics from taylor's inner circle a heart is drawn around your name in someone's handwriting not mine 
 i dont need a lot but there is one thing love has taught me its to never expect too much dont need a believable touch i just need you i just need you and i might i found life why should we be wasting time  you dont know what you missed when i look into your eyes like this and you should be in front of me seeing everything to see looking at you check out this view  think of a quiet beach think of how the waves crash down think about a summers eve no offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you walking with you in the light or in the dark well nothing shadows who you are  and you dont know what you missed when i look into your eyes like this and you should be in front of me seeing everything to see looking at you check out this view  i look outside the window everyday see something new but all i ever wanted was a window looking at you at you  and you dont know what you missed when i look into your eyes like this and you should be in front of me seeing everything to see you dont know what you missed when i look into your eyes like this and you should be in front of me seeing everything to see looking at you check out this view 
 days go by i wonder if you hear me can't you read between the lines now i'm standing still i am disappearing take this chance i'll make you mine  pre don't you wonder why you change in time makes you feel so empty inside 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room i'm spinning around i'm spinning around and all i see is someone i don't know love's got me tangled tired me too no sign of a wall sign of wall spinning me around and baby all i see is you 
 he tells lies are you really thinking that you deserve another try when you see these eyes you see another planet don't ask how but fate decides  pre don't you wonder why you change in time makes you feel so empty inside 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room i'm spinning around i'm spinning around and all i see is someone i don't know love's got me tangled tired me too no sign of a wall sign of wall spinning me around and baby all i see is you 
 spinning and turning and living and learning i should be able to handle this make it or break it move it or shake it do it or fake it girl you've got to make it 
 but love's got me cornered in the back of the room i'm spinning around i'm spinning around and all i see is someone i don't know love's got me tangled tired me too no sign of a wall sign of wall spinning me around and baby all i see is you 
 spinning me around and baby all i see is you  spinning me around and all i see is you

 here in my mind the sky looks the same on every day you loved me when we started home it started to rain you put your coat around me we stood there in the road you held me so close but did you ever let go 
 down came the rain lightning and thunder we tried in vain to hold on to each other winds of change blew you away from me right here right now i feel it on my skin the bitter sting of what we couldve been just when our love was like a burning flame down came the rain 
 in through the window i see her with you im soaked to the skin youre warm and dry i guess the storm is over for you but look at the tears here in my eyes i just stood there like a ghost as you held her so close and as i let you go 
 down came the rain lightning and thunder we tried in vain to hold on to each other winds of change blew you away from me love like this changes who you are every kiss you gave me is a scar just when our love was like a burning flame down came the rain 
 all i need is to move on fast but all i want is to have you back and it just keeps falling 
 down came the rain lightning and thunder we tried in vain to hold on to each other winds of change blew you away from me right here right now i feel it on my skin the bitter sting of what we couldve been just when our love was like a burning flame down came the rain  down came the rain 
 oh we were standing in an empty room the moonlight was falling you were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you and i could have spent a life with you but those days are over you were calling my name when your face faded from view  pre wasn't it you that told me the sun would always chase the day wasn't it you that told me 
 angels fly in the air tonight saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake stars collide in the air so light or was it just like those promises that you made on our last night 
 oh i remember waking up with you the days doing nothing you meant more to me then than you ever knew you were going to be a doctor a movie star poet at a nobel seminar hope the the world never tore that out of you  pre 
   tell me whatever happened to the things you loved and the songs we played and the indian days whatever happened to the things you gave away like harold and martin singing  i was waving as you drove away the sunlight was falling you were riding backwards in a dusty window pane 
 angels fly in the air tonight was it just like the promises that we made and stars collide in the air so light was it just like those promises that you made on our last night on our last night oh oh oh whoa whoa yeah oh

 do you know when you go you make the sweetest sight at the window if you had never come out of the blue i would have stayed up and made up you 
 you smile just like a picture it doesn't even need a frame sometimes i wait to answer just to hear you say my name and all i want is just what i've got 
 do you know when you go you make the sweetest sight at the window if you had never come out of the blue i would have stayed up and made up you 
 i'd never let you go even if i could cause i never could've dreamed you up this good 
 do you know when you go you make the sweetest sight at the window if you had never come out of the blue i would have stayed up and made up you 
 made up you oh oh made up you 
 there's a girl that you want shes everything that i am not and you can't stop thinking about her there's a thin little line and its like you cross it every time when you can't stop thinking about her 
 standing on the border looking out into the great unknown i can feel my heart beating faster as i step out on my own there's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind i'm heading out tonight traveling light i'm gonna start all over again 
 and buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train see how far i can go 'cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain and talk to someone i don't know i will face the world around me knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go and i will fall in love again because i can

 yo look if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment would you capture it or just let it slip yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud he opens his mouth but the words won't come out he's choking how everybody's joking now the clock's run out time's up overblaow  you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo  you make me smile like the sun fall outta bed sing like a bird dizzy in my head spin like a record crazy on a sunday night you make me dance like a fool forget how to breathe shine like gold buzz like a bee just the thought of you can drive me wild oh you make me smile 
 just had a conversation with the mirror i ended up not having much to say said today is for the lovers and the leaders i hate to tell you it just ain't your day  so this is my rain song it's cold outside and i still love you guess i was dead wrong you'll find out when there's clouds above you finding it ain't worth losing you when it all comes down it comes down to this only rain song you're on my mind and i still love you  and it's a complication with the voices rounding all around inside my mind i used to think this heart had lots of choices but they all lead to your doorstep every time  this is my rain song it's cold outside and i still love you guess i was dead wrong you'll find out when there's clouds above you finding it ain't worth losing you when it all comes down it comes down to this only rain song you're on my mind and i still love you  so this is my apology my words my tears are all me laid out in front of you like a grasp for truth on a sunday afternoon this is a song for you  this is my rain song it's cold outside and i still love you guess i was dead wrong and you'll find out when there's clouds above you finding it ain't worth losing you when it all comes down it comes down to this only rain song you're on my mind and i still love you ooh i still love you  i had a conversation with the mirror it ended up not having much to say 
 it would've been nice to see you coming but that would've ruined the surprise it would've been nice to have a picture perfect world but then the truth would hurt my eyes it would've been good for you to be there and every time you always would everything seems to have a picture perfect time and nothing seems to be a blur 
 it's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground it's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down but you were always there when i needed you would always see me clearly and you were never looking for a thank you i'm saying one for you 
 would've been cool to never fall down but then i never would've seen the power isn't with the picture perfect person you told me better things to come from in between 
 it's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground it's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down but you were always there when i needed you would always see me clearly and you were never looking for a thank you i'm saying one saying one saying one for you 
 it would've been nice to see you coming but that would've ruined the surprise it would've been nice to have a picture perfect world but then the truth would hurt my eyes 
  shortened but you were always there when i needed you would always see me clearly and you were never looking for a thank you i'm saying one for you 
 walking downtown shuffling my feet i try to dream my dreams above the concrete store windows traveled for miles but something i passed really caught my eye it was cracked down the middle permanent scars but i fell in love with this here 
  nice to meet you can i teach you all i know can you show me what you do where have you been what have you seen who were you before you even knew me have you been played for endless hours or were you left in the corner or were you someone's best friend this here 
  it was my baby anyone could see i love the cracks the curves the hidden beauty but i can't help wondering why it came to me and where we'll say goodbye the cracks down the middle can't see where they are since i fell in love with this here 
  nice to meet you can i teach you all i know can you show me what you do where have you been what have you seen who were you before you even knew me have you been played for endless hours or were you left in the corner or were you someone's best friend this here 
  were you a present from a father to a son did he forget you or just play you 'til you came undone hey did some primadonna love you 'til she got her fame and fortune i won't do that to you 
 nice to meet you can i teach you all i know can you show me what you do where have you been what have you seen who were you before you even knew me have you been played for endless hours or were you left in the corner or were you someone's best friend this here  you're my  this here 
 here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the he saidshe said here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us the things we're insecure about and in spite of them we jumped around together under flashing lights fireworks and confetti  to the times i learned by watching you sing along to every song that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me and that even in your worst times they can see the best in you  here's to the musical family i get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing play and dance as well as they do here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party  here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes here's to life teaching us lessons and us learning growing dancing and changing together everything i've learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you i've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums  thanks to you i'm doing better than i ever was  love taylor 
 search  where is the video of kanye telling me he was going to call me that bitch in his song it doesn't exist because it never happened you don't get to control someones emotional response to being called that bitch in front of the entire world of course i wanted to like the song i wanted to believe kanye when he told me that i would love the song i wanted us to have a friendly relationship he promised to play the song for me but he never did while i wanted to be supportive of kanye on the phone call you cannot approve a song you havent heard being falsely painted as a liar when i was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination i would very much like to be excluded from this narrative one that i have never asked to be a part of since 009 
 i like the way you wanted me every night for so long baby i like the way you needed me every time the things got rocky yeah  pre i was believing in you was i mistaken do you mean do you mean what you say when you say our love could last forever 
 well i'd rather you be mean than love and lie i'd rather hear the truth than have to say goodbye i'd rather take a blow at least then i would know but baby don't you break my heart slow 
 i like the way you'd hold me every night for so long baby i like the way you'd sing to me every time the things got rocky yeah  pre i was believing in you was i mistaken do you say do you say what you mean when you say our love could last forever 
  oh yeah yeah 
 you'd run around and lead me on forever while i stay at home still thinking we're together i want our love to last forever 
 but i'd rather you be mean than love and lie i'd rather hear the truth than have to say goodbye and i'd rather take a blow at least then i would know but baby don't you break my heart slow now baby don't you break my heart slow 
 guess mine is not the first heart broken my eyes are not the first to cry i'm not the first to know there's just no getting over you you know i'm just a fool who's willing to sit around and wait for you but baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 but now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside i'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you hopelessly devoted to you hopelessly devoted to you 
 my head is saying fool forget him my heart is saying don't let go hold on till the end and that's what i intend to do i'm hopelessly devoted to you 
 but now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside i'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you hopelessly devoted to you hopelessly devoted to you 
 any day now they're talking war i can see the look that's in your eyes they're not talking a week or two oh daddy can i go with you oh daddy can i go with you

 radio dj hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet  tim mcgraw i have heard this song  radio dj tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time  tim mcgraw it was awesome uh except for i didn't know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old  radio dj ah ha ha ha  tim mcgraw i didn't know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i don't know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that i'm old i don't know if that's true but that's what i choose to think  radio dj why don't we find out taylor is a compliment or uh he's old  taylor swift oh its definitely a compliment yeah laughing  radio dj tim mcgraw meet taylor swift  tim mcgraw nice  taylor swift nice to meet you  tim mcgraw nice to meet you taylor how you doing  taylor swift i'm doing great how are you doing  tim mcgraw i'm doing good congratulations on your record it's doing great  taylor swift thank you so much i'm just so excited thank you for uh having good music and everything i swear i'm not a stalker laughing  radio dj well  taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally 5 minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you haven't met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no we've never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i don't remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i don't know if she got it or not  taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me  tim mcgraw they didn't okay well there ya go i did laughing  radio dj so ii  taylor swift we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything  tim mcgraw not at all  radio dj so i thought i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind  taylor swift it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said tell me  taylor swift could you tell faith that i said hello  tim mcgraw i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way  taylor swift oh my gosh she's awesome  tim mcgraw i agree  radio dj this thistell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen  taylor swift well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school  tim mcgraw now i feel old  taylor swift and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well that's your first single laughing  taylor swift and i'm like well  tim mcgraw well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing  taylor swift that's awesome there's a part two coming out next month  tim mcgraw alright great laughing  tim mcgraw well congratulations 'cause it's your first single first top ten hit and thats pretty exciting and i know you're off to the races here you're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you  taylor swift awesome its been so exciting tim when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again  tim mcgraw um i don't know i don't know we'll have to look into that laughing  taylor swift well i'll i have someone who i think will be really perfect for it  tim mcgraw ya do what would  taylor swift yeah  tim mcgraw what would their name be  taylor swift uh um i think taylor something  tim mcgraw something like that yeah  taylor swift but  tim mcgraw well i'll i'll be more than happy to have you out with me  taylor swift just consider it  radio dj ah well that's very good you're pretty fearless taylor swift i'll

 it was just an old plywood boat 75 johnson and an electric choke a young girl two hands on the wheel i can't replace the way it made me feel and i would turn her sharp i would make it whine he'd say you can't beat the way a old wood boat rides just a little lake across the alabama line but i was king of the ocean when daddy let me drive 
 just an old half ton short bed ford my uncle bought new in '64 daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking a couple burnt valves and he had it going he'd let me drive her when we haul off a load down a dirt strip we'd haul trash off of thigpen road i'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals smiling like a hero who just received his medal 
 it was just an old handmedown ford with  speed on the column and a dent in the door a young girl two hands on the wheel i can't replace the way it made me feel and i would press that clutch and i would keep it right he would say a little slower girl you're doing just fine just a dirt road with trash on each side but i was mario andretti when daddy let me drive 
 soon i'll be grown up with daughters of my own i let them drive my old jeep across the pasture at our home maybe one day they'll reach back in their file and pull out that old memory and think of me and smile and say 
 it was just an old worn out jeep rusty old floor boards hot on my feet a young girl two hands on the wheel i can't replace the way it made me feel and he'd say steer it left and turn it right straighten up girl now you're doing just fine just a little valley by the river where we'd ride but i was high on a mountain when daddy let me drive oh he let me drive oh he let me drive

 i remember the eyes of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size realizing is crying out loud for every kid on stage there's a kid in the crowd 
 my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character's does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  i'm highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i'm clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey's anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i'm convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs 
 i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i'm writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you'd think that as pop writers we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009  in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book 
 if someone said three years from now you'd be long gone i'd stand up and punch them out cause they're all wrong i know better cause you said forever and ever who knew  if someone said three years from now you'd be long gone that last kiss i'll cherish until we meet again my darling who knew  because pnk is from philly ladies and gentlemen  i wish i could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too i was told i was beautiful but what does that mean to you look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair same old me again today yeah  my outsides look cool my insides are blue every time i think i'm through it's because of you i try different ways but it's all the same at the end of the day i have myself to blame i'm just trippin'  you can buy your hair if it won't grow you can fix your nose if he says so you can buy all the makeup they can make but if you can't look inside you find out who am i to be in the position that make me feel so oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh make you feel unpretty too  that's another song by an artist from philly i wanna see if you know it

 you turn your dial to 97 broadway acts like he's  selfproclaimed say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in michigan i'm just a singer of country songs just trying to play  and not do no wrong but if you listen to just one thing i say 
 you should turn z9 on broadway's electric barnyard i sing a song called tim mcgraw request it and they'll play it all day long i sing in stations all day long but there's nothing like when you're on the electric barnyard 
 daisy's from a trailer park in st louis growing up not wearing any shoes prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day growing up the other trailer park girls couldn't hide their jealousy because she had the only phone for miles now she uses it as a dj 
 so you should turn z9 on broadway's electric barnyard i sing a song called tim mcgraw request it and they'll play it all day long i sing in stations all day long but there's nothing like when you're on 
 i've been having a hard time adjusting i had the shiniest wheels now they're rusting i didn't know if you'd care if i came back i have a lot of regrets about that pulled the car off the road to the lookout could've followed my fears all the way down and maybe i don't quite know what to say but i'm here in your doorway 
 i just wanted you to know that this is me trying i just wanted you to know that this is me trying 
 they told me all of my cages were mental so i got wasted like all my potential and my words shoot to kill when i'm mad i have a lot of regrets about that i was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere fell behind all my classmates and i ended up here pouring out my heart to a stranger but i didn't pour the whiskey 
 i just wanted you to know that this is me trying i just wanted you to know that this is me trying  post at least i'm trying 
 and it's hard to be at a party when i feel like an open wound it's hard to be anywhere these days when all i want is you you're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town 
 and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying i just wanted you to know that this is me trying 
 at least i'm trying 
 lyrics for this song are not yet released 
 i used to rule the world seas would rise when i gave the word now in the morning i sleep alone sweep the streets i used to own  i used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead long live the king  one minute i held the keys next the doors were closed on me and i discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt pillars of sand  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain once you go there was never never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what i'd become  revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever wanna be king  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world 
 salt air and the rust on your door i never needed anything more oh whispers of are you sure never have i ever before 
 but i can see us lost in the memory august slipped away into a moment in time 'cause it was never mine and i can see us twisted in bedsheets august sipped away like a bottle of wine 'cause you were never mine 
 your back beneath the sun wishin' i could write my name on it will you call when you're back at school i remember thinkin' i had you 
 but i can see us lost in the memory august slipped away into a moment in time 'cause it was never mine and i can see us twisted in bedsheets august sipped away like a bottle of wine 'cause you were never mine ahhahh 
 back when we were still changin' for the better wanting was enough for me it was enough to live for the hope of it all cancel plans just in case you'd call and say meet me behind the mall so much for summer love and saying us 'cause you weren't mine to lose you weren't mine to lose no 
 'cause i can see us lost in the memory august slipped away into a moment in time 'cause it was never mine and i can see us twisted in bedsheets august sipped away like a bottle of wine you were never mine 
 you were never mine never mine but do you remember remember when i pulled up and said get in the car and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all meet me behind the mall and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all remember when i pulled up and said get in the car and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all meet me behind the mall  spoken haha i loved that 
 romeo save me i've been feeling so alone i keep screech waiting for you but you never come is this in my head i don't know what to think he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone i love you and that's all i really know i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress it's a love story baby just say yes  oh oh 'cause we were both young when i first saw you 
 vintage tee brand new phone high heels on cobblestones when you are young they assume you know nothing sequin smile black lipstick sensual politics when you are young they assume you know nothing 
 but i knew you dancin' in your levi's drunk under a streetlight i i knew you hand under my sweatshirt baby kiss it better i  refrain and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite 
 a friend to all is a friend to none chase two girls lose the one when you are young they assume you know nothing 
 but i knew you playing hideandseek and giving me your weekends i i knew you your heartbeat on the high line once in twenty lifetimes i  refrain and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite 
 to kiss in cars and downtown bars was all we needed you drew stars around my scars but now i'm bleedin' 
 'cause i knew you steppin' on the last train marked me like a bloodstain i i knew you tried to change the ending peter losing wendy i i knew you leavin' like a father running like water i 'cause when you are young they assume you know nothing 
 but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss i knew you'd haunt all of my whatifs the smell of smoke would hang around this long 'cause i knew everything when i was young i knew i'd curse you for the longest time chasin' shadows in the grocery line i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired and you'd be standin' in my front porch light and i knew you'd come back to me you'd come back to me and you'd come back to me and you'd come back  refrain and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite 
 should have been different but it wasn't different was it same old story dear john and so long should have fit like a glove should have fit like a ring like a diamond ring a token of true love should have all worked out but it didn't she should be here now but she isn't 
 there's your trouble there's your trouble you keep seeing double with the wrong one you can't see i love you you can't see she doesn't but you just keep holding on there's your trouble 
 so now you're thinking 'bout all you're missing how deep you're sinking round and round and dragging down why don't you cash in your chips why don't you call it a loss not such a big loss chalk it up better luck could have been true love but it wasn't it should all add up but it doesn't 
 there's your trouble there's your trouble you keep seeing double with the wrong one you can't see i love you you can't see she doesn't but you just keep holding on there's your trouble 
 should have all worked out but it didn't she should be here now but she isn't 
 there's your trouble there's your trouble you keep seeing double with the wrong one you can't see i love you you can't see she doesn't but you just keep holding on there's your trouble 
 drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see that i want and i'm needing everything that we should be  pre  i'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about and she's got everything that i have to live without 
 drew talks to me i laugh 'cause it's just so funny that i can't even see anyone when he's with me  pre  he says he's so in love he's finally got it right i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night 
 he's the reason for the teardrops on my  the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do 
 drew walks by me can't he tell that i can't breathe and there he goes so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be  pre  she'd better hold him tight give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause 
 he's the reason for the teardrops on my  the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do 
 so i drive home alone as i turn off the light i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight 
 'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my  the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do 
 he's the time taken up but there's never enough and he's all that i need to fall into drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see 
 what did you think i'd say to that does a scorpion sting when fighting back they strike to kill and you know i will you know i will what do you sing on your drive home do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn does she smile or does she mouth fuck you forever  pre every time you call me crazy i get more crazy what about that and when you say i seem angry i get more angry 
 and there's nothing like a mad woman what a shame she went mad no one likes a mad woman you made her like that and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out and you find something to wrap your noose around and there's nothing like a mad woman 
 now i breathe flames each time i talk my cannons all firin' at your yacht they say move on but you know i won't and women like hunting witches too doing your dirtiest work for you it's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together  pre every time you call me crazy i get more crazy what about that and when you say i seem angry i get more angry 
 and there's nothing like a mad woman what a shame she went mad no one likes a mad woman you made her like that and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out and you find something to wrap your noose around and there's nothing like a mad woman 
 i'm taking my time taking my time 'cause you took everything from me watching you climb watching you climb over people like me the master of spin has a couple side flings good wives always know she should be mad should be scathing like me but 
 no one likes a mad woman what a shame she went mad you made her like that 
 green was the color of the grass where i used to read at centennial park i used to think i would meet somebody there teal was the color of your shirt when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop you used to work at to make a little money 
 time curious time gave me no compasses gave me no signs were there clues i didn't see and isn't it just so pretty to think all along there was some invisible string tying you to me oohoohoohooh 
 bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to la you ate at my favorite spot for dinner bold was the waitress on our threeyear trip getting lunch down by the lakes she said i looked like an american singer 
 time mystical time cutting me open then healing me fine were there clues i didn't see and isn't it just so pretty to think all along there was some invisible string tying you to me oohoohoohooh 
 a string that pulled me out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire chains around my demons wool to brave the seasons one single thread of gold tied me to you 
 cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart now i send their babies presents gold was the color of the leaves when i showed you around centennial park hell was the journey but it brought me heaven 
 time wondrous time gave me the blues and then purplepink skies and it's cool baby with me and isn't it just so pretty to think all along there was some invisible string tying you to me oohoohoohooh me oohoohoohooh 
 ahahah yeah oohoohoohooh oh no 
 i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor

 i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is 98 the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in 944 near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in 98 it's almost like she's golden 
 to put it plainly we just couldnt stop writing songs to try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music we chose to wander deeper in ive never done this before in the past ive always treated albums as oneoff eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released there was something different with folklore in making it i felt less like i was departing and more like i was returning i loved the escapism i found in these imaginarynot imaginary tales i loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives so i just kept writing them
